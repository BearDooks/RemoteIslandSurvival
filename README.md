# Remote Island Survival v0.1

## Can you survive on the island??

You wake on what apears to be an remote island in the middle of no where. You can't remember how you go there, or where you came from. Can you survive in this new world?

This is a game where you make decisions for the player on the island of what to do and what to make. Each choice can have a direct impact on your island life.
